# PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT-ANALYSIS

### IMPLEMENTION OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY FOR DETECTING LEAF SPECIES

- Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning
- It is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation
- These new transformed features are called the Principal Components
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and the output is predicted
- Finally, the predicted output is visualized
